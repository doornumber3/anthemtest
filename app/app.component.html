    Revolver is a 2005 British-French crime thriller film co-written and directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and Andr√© Benjamin. The film centres on a revenge-seeking confidence trickster whose weapon is a universal formula that guarantees victory to its user, when applied to any game or confidence trick.
    
    This is the fourth feature film by Ritchie and his third to centre on crime and professional criminals. It was released in UK theatres on 22 September 2005. It performed poorly at the box office and received negative reviews but has gained a small cult following among fans of Guy Ritchie's previous crime films. A reworked version[2] was released to a limited number of US theatres on 7 December 2007

    Hostel: Part II is a 2007 American splatter film written and directed by Eli Roth, and the sequel to his 2005 horror film Hostel. It stars Lauren German, Roger Bart, Heather Matarazzo, Bijou Phillips, and Richard Burgi and was produced by Chris Briggs, Mike Fleiss, and Eli Roth; Boaz Yakin, Scott Spiegel, and Quentin Tarantino are executive producers. Like its predecessor, the film is set in Slovakia and centers on a facility in which rich clients pay to torture (to death, which is mandatory) kidnapped victims.
    
    The film did not perform as well as the original, totaling $17 million in the US by the end of its theatrical run[2] whereas the original made $19 million in its opening weekend.
